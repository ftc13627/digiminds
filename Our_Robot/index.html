    <p class="bold-text">Chassis</p>
    <p class="text">Chassis is the key component in the robot. it has to be strong enough to hold all the other components and needs to be able to move easily in all directions. First, we started with a 14x14 inch considering the weight factor. Now, we created a 16x16 because the arm was interfering with the intake.</p>

    <p class="bold-text">Latching Mechanism</p>
    <p class="text">The Chain along with Linear slide mechanism is used for Latching the Robot to the lander. The Chain is run through 3 gears one at the top, one attached to the Motor and 3rd one at the bottom. The Slide is attached to the chassis. The Linear slide and the Chain are connected using a small plate. Once robot is latched on to the lander, a Servo is used to lock the slider</p>

    <p class="bold-text">Mineral Arm</p>
    <p class="text">One end of the arm was attached to the channel, gear and a motor. The bottom of the arm is a box for collecting the minerals. With the help of a motor the arm moved. </p>
