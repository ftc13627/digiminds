    <p class="bold-text">Mission Statement:</p>
    <p class="text">The Digiminds 2.0 are a team of young middle school students devoted to the inspiration and recognition of science and technology. Our team mission is to engage and inspire youth to pursue their passions in STEAM in order to cultivate the future leaders and innovators of the world in the interest of societal change. We hope to direct the flow of culture towards a better tomorrow and prepare our members for the challenges of the future.</p>

    <p class="bold-text">Team Origin:</p>
    <p class="text">The Digiminds 2.0 is a FTC team that started in 2017.
Last year, it was our first FTC competition. We were really nervous because we did not know what we should expect from the competition. Even though we got twenty-sixth place, we are very proud that we learned a lot about building and coding our robot. Plus, it gave us a idea on how FTC works. Not only did we learn about engineering, but we also got the Design Award. We found the mistakes we did from last year’s competition and we will do our best to fix those mistakes. Now, Digiminds 2.0 comes back with a new mindset and an eager urge to learn even more about engineering.   </p>
    <br>
    <p class="bold-text">Location</p>
    <p class="text">We meet weekly at the same place. We don’t move places every week because when we moved places last year, it was too hard for us to take all of the things that we needed to every house. After learning our lesson, we decided that the stuff should stay in one place, and if anyone wanted to take the robot home, they could, but they would have to bring it back to the same house. This way, we would not have the problem of transporting everything. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="bold-text">Sustainability</p>
    <p class="text">Although this is our second year, we believe we have a lot of resources in order to be sustainable and continue our team’s history. We are apart of an organization called Troy Youth Robotics where we are able to get mentors and other interested students to join our team. If we ever need more help we can contact TYR and ask for extra help through mentorship from FRC students. Also, in the beginning of the season we can pull interested students from the district. Being apart of the TYR also allows us to have a good relationship with the Troy School District.
