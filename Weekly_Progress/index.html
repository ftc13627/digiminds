    <p class="text">Above is pictures of our goal and the progress that we made. During the first class, we made the goals for each and every class so that we could finish our robot on time. We also decided on what we will be doing in autonomous and tele-op. Also, we have included the progress that we have made from the beginning of our robotics classes to the qualifier.</p>
