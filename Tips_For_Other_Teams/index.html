    <p class="bold-text">Suggestions for the Robot:</p>
    <p class="text">One of the ways that you could make your robot better is by using mechanum wheels. This will allow the robot to be able to move to the left and to the right. Another way that you could make your robot better is by having a good intake and a way to easily get the minerals into the crater. We were able to use a lead screw, a mineral holder, and an arm. </p>

    <p class="bold-text">Suggestions for the Software:</p>
    <p class="text">One of the ways that you could make your software better is by using TenserFlow for the robot to detect the gold and silver minerals for sampling. We did this becuase if we used a color sensor, it is more time consuming. By using TenserFlow, we are able to detect where the gold mineral and silver minerals are while we are still latched on.</p>
