    <p class="bisr">Buckthorn Invasive Species Reduction</p>
    <p class="bisrd">In Troy, we learned that there was an invasive species known as buckthorn. This european plant takes over areas, outcompeting native vegetation. This can have terrible consequences for the plants and wildlife. The Raintree Village Homeowner’s Association is working to eradicate buckthorn found at the Lakeside Commons. We decided to help out and work to eradicate invasive species. </p>

    <p class="bisr">Troy Youth Robotics FLL and FTC Drop-In</p>
    <p class="bisrd">We attended most of the FTC and FLL drop-ins at Troy High School. They had a full field there so we were able to demonstrate our robot and our programs to the FLL teams that attended. It allowed the FLL teams to have exposure of the processes in FTC and see what they will be doing next year. </p>

    <p class="bisr">Forgotten Harvest Food Donation</p>
    <p class="bisrd">Every day, 1 in 7 people die of hunger and 90% of people squander their food. This year our team's objective was to save the people’s day-to-day food expenses and give the food they need. Our team went to a local donation center called “Forgotten Harvest”. It is a donation center that grants more than 138,000 boxes of food per day. Our task this year was to put different types of vegetables for each family in a box. At the food organization, Forgotten Harvest, our FTC team reached out to the community and packed food, that would otherwise go to waste, for the those who couldn’t afford any. We took extra precautions before starting to pack the food,  cleanliness and respect were important. We wore aprons, hair nets, and gloves so no hair, germs, or particles on clothing can get in their food. We were told not to disrespect the food and playing with food could get it dirty or damage it. In the end, we learned to value food and not take anything for granted, we should consider ourselves lucky to be living with food and water every day. Our team learned lots of things. Every crumb and piece can help someone, though we don't know how many people starve each and every day without food. We were glad to pack it for them.
